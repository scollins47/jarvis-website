### v0.2.5

*Oct 8, 2015*

+ Add "pipe" shape.

+ Add Biovision BVH mocap file parser and mocap animator.

+ Add mocap skeleton demo.

### v0.2.4

*Sep 23, 2015*

+ Integrate Simplex3D noise generator into library.

### v0.2.3

*Mar 17, 2015*

+ Add depth of field demo that uses stackblur to create a depth-of-field effect.

+ Text shapes now compute an affine tranformation to utilize canvas and svg transforms on text.

+ Parsing hex and CSS color strings for easy material setting.

### v0.2.2

*April 29, 2014*

+ Add bounding box calculation to render model.

+ Expose painters on seen namespace so they may be extended.

+ Expose more mouse events on the dragger interaction.

### v0.2.1

*April 27, 2014*

+ Add 'g' tag to context utility method to easily use SVG groups.

### v0.2.0

*April 11, 2014*

+ Fix specular phong shading calculation.

+ Move viewport into scene to make scene construction cleaner.

+ Cameras are now seen.Transformable objects

+ Points and shaders utilities use functions instead of raw objects (e.g. seen.Points.X()) for a more consistent API.

+ Animators have timestamps and time-delta and transitions have time-since-start and duration-fraction all in milliseconds for better animation consistency across environments.

+ Added transformation baking so transformables can be reset to a non-identity matrix.

### v0.1.5

*April 10, 2014*

+ Change animator method to 'frame' instead of 'render' for a more agnostic API.

+ Add RenderAnimator.

+ Add Transitions and TransitionAnimator.

+ Adding touch interactions for swipe-to-rotate on mobile.

### v0.1.4

*April 6, 2014*

+ Issue #2. Switch to using requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout for animation if available.

### v0.1.3

*April 6, 2014*

+ Fixed bug where matrix scaling was not properly computed and viewport prescale and postscale were incorrect.

+ Added pyramid shape and updated extrude function to offset in any direction

### v0.1.2

*April 2, 2014*

+ Add flag to disable renderModel caching (not recommended)

+ Prevent default scroll action on canvases when zoomer is attached.

+ More documentation for Docco.

### v0.1.1

*March 25, 2014*

+ Removed default fill layer and change default create context method for simplicity and clarity.

+ Removed width/height requirement for creating contexts. Now width/height is only necessary to align viewport.

+ Updated tests to include both SVG and Canvas renderings

### v0.1.0 - *INITIAL RELEASE*

*March 24, 2014*

#### Features

+ Render 3D scenes into SVG or HTML5 Canvas elements.

+ Shape primivites :
 + tetrahedron
 + cube
 + sphere (sub-divided icosahedron)
 + patch (triangulated)
 + Wavefront .obj format parser

+ Perspective and orthographic projections. 1:1 pixel-aligned viewport in z=1 plane.

+ Hierarchically transformed and lit scene models.

+ Ambient, point, and directional light sources.

+ Phong ambient, diffuse and specular lighting model per surface.

+ Simple event-based animator.

+ Mouse drag and scroll adapters for mouse-look and mousewheel-zoom.

+ Scene layering and re-contextualization. Use multiple scenes in one context or use one scene in multiple contexts.

+ Customizeable shapes, painters, and shaders.

+ Performance: z-order painter's algorithm, backface culling, point rounding, rendermodel caching, lazy evaluation of tranformations.

+ No dependencies
