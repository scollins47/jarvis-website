# ## Scene
# ------------------

# A `Scene` is the main object for a view of a scene.
class seen.Scene
  defaults: ->
    # The root model for the scene, which contains `Shape`s, `Light`s, and
    # other `Model`s
    model            : new seen.Model()

    # The `Camera`, which defines the projection transformation. The default
    # projection is perspective.
    camera           : new seen.Camera()

    # The `Viewport`, which defines the projection from shape-space to
    # projection-space then to screen-space. The default viewport is on a
    # space from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). To map more naturally to pixels, create a
    # viewport with the same width/height as the DOM element.
    viewport         : seen.Viewports.origin(1,1)

    # The scene's shader determines which lighting model is used.
    shader           : seen.Shaders.phong()

    # The `cullBackfaces` boolean can be used to turn off backface-culling
    # for the whole scene. Beware, turning this off can slow down a scene's
    # rendering by a factor of 2. You can also turn off backface-culling for
    # individual surfaces with a boolean on those objects.
    cullBackfaces    : true

    # The `fractionalPoints` boolean determines if we round the surface
    # coordinates to the nearest integer. Rounding the coordinates before
    # display speeds up path drawing  especially when using an SVG context
    # since it cuts down on the length of path data. Anecdotally, my speedup
    # on a complex demo scene was 10 FPS. However, it does introduce a slight
    # jittering effect when animating.
    fractionalPoints : false

    # The `cache` boolean (default : true) enables a simple cache for
    # renderModels, which are generated for each surface in the scene. The
    # cache is a simple Object keyed by the surface's unique id. The cache has
    # no eviction policy. To flush the cache, call `.flushCache()`
