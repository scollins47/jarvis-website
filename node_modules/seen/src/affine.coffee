# ## Affine
# #### Fake projections with affine transforms
# ------------------
#
# It is not possible exactly render text in a scene with a perspective
# projection because Canvas and SVG support only affine transformations. So,
# in order to fake it, we create an affine transform that approximates the
# linear effects of a perspective projection on an unrendered planar surface
# that represents the text's shape. We can use this transform directly in the
# text painter to warp the text.
#
# This fake projection will produce unrealistic results with large strings of
# text that are not broken into their own shapes.
seen.Affine = {

  # This is the set of points that must be used by a surface that will use an
  # affine transform for rendering.

  # Because we control the initial values of the points, we can re-use the
  # state matrix. Furthermore, because we have use a special layout (upper
  # triangular) for this matrix, we avoid any matrix factorization and can go
  # directly to back-substitution to solve the matrix equation.

  # To use the affine transform, use the indices like so (note that we flip y):
