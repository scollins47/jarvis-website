# ## Models
# ------------------

# The object model class. It stores `Shapes`, `Lights`, and other `Models` as
# well as a transformation matrix.
#
# Notably, models are hierarchical, like a tree. This means you can isolate
# the transformation of groups of shapes in the scene, as well as create
# chains of transformations for creating, for example, articulated skeletons.
